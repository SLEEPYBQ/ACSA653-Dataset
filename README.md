# ACSA653 Dataset Overview

- **Dataset Name**: ACSA653
- **Scale**: Comprises 653 video clips
- **Number of Classes**: 6 types of stereotyped movements
  - Categories include: body swing, hand clap, head skewed, overactive, hand dancing, and poke
- **Data Collection Environment**: 
  - Collected in a Mixed Reality (MR) Aquarium Training System to ensure natural behavior.
  - During training, children interacted with virtual creatures, with a camera positioned above the aquarium to record their actions.
- **Video Quality**: Manually cropped and edited to ensure uniform specifications and high quality.
- **Participants**: 6 children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
- **Data Annotation**: 
  - Annotated manually by five doctors, recording the start and end times of the stereotyped movements and their categories.
  - Videos were segmented and categorized based on the annotated movement types.
- **Comparison Advantages**:
  - Compared to existing public datasets, ACSA653 offers significant advantages in terms of sample size, action categories, and modalities (RGB+Skeleton).

This dataset provides a valuable resource for studying the recognition of stereotyped movements in children with ASD, facilitating deeper analysis of behavioral patterns.
